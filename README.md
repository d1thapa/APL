# Custom Programming Language(FunLang)
- The "FunLang" was developed and implemented that can perform arithmetic calculations as well as data manipulation, and support object-oriented programming concepts. In addition, the language is Turing complete. 
- The syntax of the language was adapted from Backus-Naur Form(BNF) grammar whereas the basic structre of FunLang was influenced by ALGOL, JAVA, and C#.
- Built the lexer (convert the program strings to tokens), the parser (build the parse tree from the tokens produced by the lexer), and the interpreter (produce the output of the program using the parse tree) to implement the "FunLang" and to analyze and troubleshoot the issues.
