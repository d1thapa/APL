# Custom Programming Language
- Created and implemented a custom programming language called "FunLang" that was Turin complete, can perform arithmetic calculations as well as data manipulation, and support object-oriented programming concepts.
- Designed basic structure of FunLang that are influenced by ALGOL and C#.
- The syntax of the language was adapted from Backus-Naur Form(BNF). 
- Built the lexer (convert the program strings to tokens), the parser (build the parse tree from the tokens produced by the lexer), and the interpreter (produce the output of the program using the parse tree).
